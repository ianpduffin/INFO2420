<h2> Website 1 Critique - Jami Lin</h2>
<h3><a href = "https://www.jamilin.com">www.jamilin.com</a></h3>
<ol>
	<li>My first impression of this site was a surprise. I was somewhat "jump scared" by the 6 different images of Jami Lin 
	staring at me through the screen, it was startling to say the least.</li>
	<li>Right below the main banner, there is a small menu with links to different webpages centered on the screen. 
	Right below that is here 5 main practices, all with links at the top, a different image of her face,
	 and a small list of information pertaining to each practice.</li>
	<li>This site is structured strangely, there are multiple links to each of her practices which are unnecessary. 
	Those links also lead to external websites, which all have problems in their own right. 
	The lists describing her different practices are covered by links making them unreadable.</li>
	<li>The graphics, multimedia, and layout all portray a sense that an amateur made this website, which detracts from it a lot. 
	Again the multiple images of her face is way too much, I think this lady may have a bit of an ego. </li>
	<li>The page didn't take long to load, only a couple seconds.</li>
	<li>The multicolored page links are somewhat hard to read because of the white text, even more so on the yellow one.
	The lists she has for her practices are in a small font which can be somewhat hard to read.</li>
	<li>The site didn't have a traditional navigation bar. 
	There is only the multicolored banner at the top with separate links to her practices/products page.</li>
	<li>Each page linked from the home page has a color theme associated with it based on the color of the link. 
	Some of them are well executed while others aren't. Between pages there is little continuity and the formatting is different for each of them.</li>
	<li>I had the page in a smaller window so I could write this Critique. This caused some issues with information being covered up. 
	Some pages had no responsive design, some did. Overall it wasn't executed well and caused some issues.</li>
	<li>This site offers very unusual holistic medicine and spiritual guidance practices. 
	I have to commend Jami Lin for the hustle, and I appreciate the early internet aesthetic.
	Her visage on my screen really seems to stare into my soul. I have never experienced a site quite like this.</li>
